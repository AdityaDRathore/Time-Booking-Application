# Security Considerations
## 1. Token Security:

Access tokens are never stored persistently in the browser
Refresh tokens use HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks
Both token types include expiration timestamps

## 2. Password Security:

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (cost factor: 12)
Failed login attempts are rate-limited
Password strength requirements enforced

## 3. API Protection:

HTTPS required for all communications
CSRF protection via custom tokens
Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## 4. Session Management:

Active sessions tracked in Redis
Forced logout capability for admins
Automatic session termination on password change
