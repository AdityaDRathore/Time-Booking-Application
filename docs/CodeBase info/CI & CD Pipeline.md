# CI/CD Pipeline Plan for Time-Booking Application

## Initial Zero-Cost Approach: GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is ideal for your initial CI/CD setup because:
- Completely free for public repositories
- 2,000 minutes/month free for private repositories
- Native integration with your GitHub repository
- YAML-based configuration makes it portable to other CI/CD systems

### Implementation Process for GitHub Actions

1. **Create workflow directory structure**:

├── .github 
│   └── workflows 
│       ├── backend-ci.yml 
│       ├── frontend-ci.yml 
│       └── deploy.yml

2. **Backend CI workflow** (`backend-ci.yml`):
- Triggers: Push to main branch, PRs to main, manual triggers
- Steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Set up Node.js
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linting
  - Run tests
  - Build application

3. **Frontend CI workflow** (`frontend-ci.yml`):
- Similar structure to backend but with frontend-specific commands
- Add steps for building production assets

4. **Deployment workflow** (`deploy.yml`):
- Initially can deploy to a self-hosted server via SSH
- Can be triggered manually or automatically after CI passes

## Self-Hosted Deployment Options (Free)

1. **Deploy to your own server**:
- Use GitHub Actions to build and then SCP/RSYNC files to your server
- Use PM2 or similar for Node.js process management

2. **GitHub Pages for frontend** (if applicable):
- Free static hosting
- Workflow can automatically deploy React build artifacts

## Future Migration Path

The setup is designed to be portable:

1. **Modular workflow files** that separate concerns (testing, building, deploying)
2. **Environment variables** for configuration instead of hardcoded values
3. **Standardized build artifacts** that could be deployed anywhere

### Easy Migration To:

- **GitLab CI/CD**: Similar YAML structure, easy to port workflows
- **Jenkins**: Can reuse most scripts, just need to adapt to Jenkinsfile format
- **Azure DevOps**: Similar YAML-based approach
- **CircleCI**: Offers a free tier with similar configuration approach

## Testing & Quality Gates

Include these in your pipelines:

1. **Unit tests** must pass before merge
2. **Code coverage** reports
3. **Security scanning** with free tools like OWASP Dependency Check
4. **Linting** for code quality

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Set up basic CI workflows for backend and frontend
2. **Week 2**: Add test automation and quality gates
3. **Week 3**: Implement deployment workflow for dev environment
4. **Week 4**: Document the process and train team members

### Current Progress 

- Have setup up only backend & frontend ci-yml.
- skip deploy.yml for now as will be later added whenever ready to deploy anything.  
- didn't setup up any secrets in Github, as not deploying anything. 

**What to Ignore for Now**:
1. Database migrations setup
2. Environment variables for deployment
3. Deployment platform configuration (Railway/Vercel)
3. All the deployment secrets
